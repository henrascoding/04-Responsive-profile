     <h2>What's I'm passionate about?</h2>
       <p>I love football, although at the moment I'm living in Portugal and it's difficult to follow Brazilian football because of the time difference.</p>
       <p>I'm also a big fan of comics and I have a strong love for illustration, something I've done since I was little and got to work with.</p>
       <p>Last year I started studying architecture at the University of BrasÃ­lia, but due to moving countries I had to drop out of the course.</p>
       <p>I started taking the LeWagon bootcamp because I wanted to enter the technology field and have more freedom to travel the world and discover new cultures and landscapes.</p>
